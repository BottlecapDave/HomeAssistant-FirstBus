# Home Assistant First Bus

Custom component built to bring you bus times for First Buses. This was built because buses in my area stopped having live times available in [UK Transport integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/uk_transport/), and time tabled based times were only available using the more expensive `nextbuses` call.

This is unofficial and in no way endorsed by First Bus.

!!! warning
    
    This component uses a private API used by [First Bus website](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/next-bus), so it could break at any time. I will do my best to keep the component working.
