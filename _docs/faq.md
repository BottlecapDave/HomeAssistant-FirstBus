## How do I increase the logs for the integration?

If you are having issues, it would be helpful to include Home Assistant logs as part of any raised issue. This can be done by following the [instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#enabling-debug-logging) outlined by Home Assistant.

You should run these logs for about a day and then include the contents in the issue. Please be sure to remove any personal identifiable information from the logs before including them.
